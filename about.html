  <h1>We’re athletes who refused to let heat win.</h1>
  <p>NITROCOOL was founded by runners, engineers, and trainers after we lost a teammate to exertional heat stroke. Our mission: give every high-school and club athlete a simple, science-backed way to stay cool—and alive—when temperatures spike.</p>
